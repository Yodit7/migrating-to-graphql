          First your score is computed for each language using this formula:
          <div class="">
            <pre>
              <code class="language-html" data-lang="html">sum(stars) + (1.0 - 1.0/count(repositories))</code>
            </pre>
          </div>
          
          <p>Then you are ranked according to your score compared to other developers with repositories in the same language or in the same location (by city, by country or worldwide).</p>
          
          <p>If you're interested in the ranking you should have a look at the SQL query that generates the ranking table: <a href="https://github.com/vdaubry/github-awards/blob/master/sql/rank.sql">rank.sql</a></p>

          Git Awards retrieves data from 2 sources:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.githubarchive.org/">GitHub Archive</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          
          For a detailed explanation of how the data was processed, see the project readme: <a href="https://github.com/vdaubry/github-awards">https://github.com/vdaubry/github-awards</a>

          We get the number of stars for each repo from <a href="https://www.githubarchive.org/">GitHub Archive</a>. Most likely the data for some of your repos are not up to date.

          We plan to add GitHub connect and allow you to ask for a refresh. In the meantime you can reach me on Twitter if some of your data is not accurate: @vdaubry

          The GitHub search is great and you should use it everytime it can answer your question. However there are some things that can't be done with GitHub search:
          
          <ul>
            <li>
              The main difference is that you can't search for YOUR ranking with GitHub search.
            </li>
            <li>
              You cannot search for top users by total number of stars.
            </li>
            <li>
              Location on GitHub is a plain text field, so if you search for users in "San Francisco", you won't find users with location "SF, CA" or any other variations. You cannot search for a user by country if they have only filled in their city.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          Git Awards geocodes user locations, so provided you filled your city in your location, you can have your ranking in your city, in your country, and worldwide.

        I care a lot about this project not being creepy. It doesn't display your name or your email, you cannot search for someone by name or get access to their email. Only GitHub username, avatar, repository list, location, and repository language.

        Though we don't display it, the database might contain information <strong>already publicly available</strong> on your GitHub profile:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Email
          </li>
          <li>
            Full name
          </li>
          <li>
            Location
          </li>
          <li>
            Picture (avatar)
          </li>
          <li>
            Website or blog URL
          </li>
          <li>
            Company
          </li>
        </ul>

        If you want to edit or remove any of this information, you can reach me on twitter.
